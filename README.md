## Projects
### Web Portfolio Web Developer:(Ongoing)  [Project Link](https://github.com/Keshav15/portfolio_app)

The script sends resume details to the LLM model which converts the resume info into Json format, saves formatted data to a new file, and in the backend, a JSON file will be deployed and secretly creates the repo and then generates a deployed Portfolio link for the user.
Tech Used:Streamlit/AWS Lambda,LangChain,Fast API,API,Tensorflow


### Text Summarization  [Project Link](https://github.com/KIRTIBAJAJ2002/Project1-Scraper-beanstalk-deployment)

I developed a robust system capable of automatically generating **concise summaries from large volumes of text**. This project involved data preprocessing, feature engineering, and the implementation of advanced NLP algorithms, including sequence-to-sequence models and transformer architectures. I conducted rigorous evaluations using established **metrics such as ROUGE and BLEU**to assess the quality of the generated summaries.
Tech Used:TensorFlow,NLTK,.
